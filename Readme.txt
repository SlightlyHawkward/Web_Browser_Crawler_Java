The webcrawler portion of this assignment was done using Sublime Text 2 and compiled through use of .bat scripts on a Windows 7 computer. 

The Browser portion of this lab was done in Eclipse EE on the same windows 7 computer. 

The servlet is called ServletExample because I used an online tutorial for the base and didn't want to risk messing anything up towards the end by re-naming anything.

If you want to use any of this code, give credit to where you found it. Programmed for Prof. Gustavo's CS390-JAVA course at Purdue University Spring 2014. Don't use this code in that course if you are taking it, you'll fail. They catch that sort of thing.
